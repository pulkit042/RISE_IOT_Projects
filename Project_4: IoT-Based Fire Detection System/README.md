## 📲 Mobile Notification Example

Whenever gas or fire is detected, a mobile notification is instantly sent via the **Blynk app**:

## 🧠 Working Principle

1. The **DHT22** constantly measures the ambient **temperature**.
2. The **MQ-2 sensor** reads gas levels (e.g., smoke or LPG).
3. If either:
   - Temperature ≥ **50°C**
   - Gas level ≥ **1000**
   
   ➜ It triggers a **red LED**, **buzzer**, and a **Blynk push notification**.

4. When conditions are back to safe:
   - **Red LED + buzzer** turn off
   - **Green LED** turns on again

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Wiring

| Component | ESP32 Pin |
|----------|------------|
| DHT22 VCC | 3.3V      |
| DHT22 GND | GND       |
| DHT22 Data | D4       |
| MQ-2 Analog | A2 (GPIO34) |
| Buzzer    | D18       |
| Red LED   | D19       |
| Green LED | D21       |

> ⚠️ Use resistors with LEDs to avoid damage (220Ω recommended)

---

### 2. Blynk Setup (Simplified)

- Download **Blynk IoT** app on your mobile
- Create new template: `Fire Detector`
- Get your **Auth Token**
- Add `Notification` widget and set up an **event** named `fire_alert`
- In Web Dashboard, under `Events`, enable **Push Notification**

---

## 🧾 Code

Arduino code is available in `fire_detection.ino`.  
Key logic includes:

- Reading temperature from DHT22
- Reading gas value from MQ-2
- Sending notification via Blynk if danger is detected

---

## 🌐 Cloud Integration

This project uses **Blynk.Cloud** for mobile alerts.  
Easy to set up, real-time notifications ensure that you're always informed in case of emergencies.
