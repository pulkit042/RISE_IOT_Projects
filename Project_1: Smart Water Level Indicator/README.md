# 💧 Smart Water Level Indicator 🚰

This Arduino-based project monitors the water level in a tank using an **ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)** and displays the level on an **I2C 16x2 LCD** in **centimeters**. It uses a **LED bar graph** to indicate water level visually and activates a **buzzer alert** when the tank is near full (within 4 cm). The tank height is configurable and currently set to **400 cm**.

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. The **HC-SR04** measures the distance between the sensor and the water surface.
2. Water level = `tank height - measured distance`.
3. LCD displays this level in **cm** and shows a **progress bar**.
4. LED bar graph lights up proportionally.
5. When the water level is **≥ 396 cm**, the buzzer rings.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Upload the Code

1. Open `water_level_indicator.ino` in Arduino IDE.
2. Select your Arduino board and COM port.
3. Upload and power on the setup.

### Wiring Reference

- **Ultrasonic Sensor**
  - VCC → 5V
  - GND → GND
  - TRIG → Pin 9
  - ECHO → Pin 8
- **I2C LCD**
  - SDA → A4
  - SCL → A5
- **LED Bar Graph**
  - Connect 10 digital pins (e.g., 2 to 11) via 220Ω resistors.
- **Buzzer**
  - Positive (+) → Pin A0
  - Negative (–) → GND
