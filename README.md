# IoT Projects Repository

Welcome to my official project repository. I have worked on a total of **IoT-based projects**, each focused on real-world applications using embedded systems, sensors, and wireless communication.

This repository will serve as a central hub for all my project code, simulations, images, documentation, and learnings.
