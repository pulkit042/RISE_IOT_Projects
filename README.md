# 🌐 RISE Internship 2025 – IoT Projects Repository

Welcome to my official project repository for the **RISE Internship 2025**. During this internship, I will be working on a total of **8 IoT-based projects**, each focusing on real-world applications using embedded systems, sensors, and wireless communication.

This repository will serve as a central hub for all my project code, simulations, images, documentation, and learnings.
